<h1>With Gemini Agent inside Android Studio</h1>
Me: ok so I tried to add animation <br/>
for when the fullscreen and orientation change <br/>
occurs but I guess maybe I added at the wrong modifier<br/>
<br/>
Gemini: You are right, the animateContentSize modifier is <br/>
likely in the wrong place.<br/>
When you have a composable whose size <br/>
change affects its parent, it's often better to apply <br/>
animateContentSize to the parent. <br/>
This allows the parent to smoothly animate its own adjustment<br/>
to the child's new size.In your case, the Box containing <br/>
the video player changes size, and the parent Column <br/>
has to adapt. Let's move the animateContentSize modifier <br/>
from the Box to the Column. I'll make that change for you.<br/>
Read MainActivity.kt<br/>
<br/>
Me: Any more suggestions of where I could be using animations.<br/>
Gemini: Of course! Here are a few suggestions to make your UI <br/>
even more engaging with animations.<br/>
A great place to start is the controls overlay. <br/>
Right now, it appears and disappears abruptly. <br/>
We can make this feel more polished by having the controls <br/>
slide in and out from the bottom of the screen.<br/>
I'll add slideInVertically and slideOutVertically animations <br/>
to the AnimatedVisibility that's already wrapping <br/>
your ControlsRow. I'll also add a fade in and fade out for a smoother effect.<br/>
<br/>
Me: I just wanna make fullscreen transitions more seamless.<br/>
I still dont understand why it takes so much time for the video to begin playing <br/>
again after fullscreen or fullscreen exit<br/>
Gemini: You've hit on a classic challenge in Android development. <br/>
The delay you're seeing when transitioning to and from fullscreen is happening <br/>
because changing the screen orientation is causing your entire MainActivity <br/>
to be destroyed and then created again.When the activity <br/>
is recreated, the video player is completely <br/>
re-initialized‚Äîit has to detach from the old view, <br/>
create a new one, attach to it, and then buffer <br/>
and restart the video stream. This entire process is <br/>
what's causing that noticeable lag.<br/>
To fix this and make the transition seamless, <br/>
we need to tell the Android system that our activity will handle <br/>
orientation changes itself, instead of letting the system <br/>
tear it down and rebuild it.We can do this by making a <br/>
small change to your project's AndroidManifest.xml file. <br/>
I'll locate that file and add the necessary configuration<br/> 
for you.<br/>

<h1>Regular Gemini Chat In Android Studio</h1>
<br/>
Me: ok can you merge the paths into one in the ic-launcher_monochrome.xml
<br/>
Gemini: Of course. You are right, that is the exact problem<br/>
that needs to be solved.The issue is that your <br/>
ic_launcher_monochrome.xml file has multiple paths elements. <br/>
For a themed icon to work, the system requires a single combined path.<br/>
I will now merge all the pathData strings from your file into one and <br/>
update the XML. This will fix the adaptive icon issue.<br/>
File to Edit: app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_monochrome.xml<br/>
I will replace the entire content of your file with this corrected version, <br/>
which contains the single, merged path. <br/> <br/>
<h1>With Chat GPT</h1>
Me: okay scrap exoplayer, let's use vlc, is it harder?<br/>
Chat GPT: Much simpler, honestly. üòÖ <br/>

Using VLC (LibVLC) for Android gives you:<br/>

Out-of-the-box support for any RTSP variant VLC can play (AAC, H264, LATM, MP4A, etc.).<br/>

Immediate playback without the weird ExoPlayer AAC issues.<br/>

Audio and video guaranteed to work, and you can control volume easily.<br/>

It‚Äôs a bit different from Media3/ExoPlayer in setup, but not really harder ‚Äî it‚Äôs arguably easier for RTSP streams, because you don‚Äôt fight decoder quirks.<br/>

Steps in a nutshell<br/>

Add LibVLC dependency in build.gradle:<br/>

implementation 'org.videolan.android:libvlc-all:3.5.1'<br/>


Inject or create a VLC player in your Hilt module (optional, like your ExoPlayer setup).<br/>

Compose AndroidView for the org.videolan.libvlc.util.VLCVideoLayout and attach the player.<br/>

Set media with:<br/>

val media = Media(libVLC, Uri.parse(rtspUri))<br/>
mediaPlayer.media = media<br/>
mediaPlayer.play()<br/>


Audio works immediately<br/>

No weird freezes<br/>

Video starts almost instantly<br/><br/>
Me: It seemed to work on rotation when it was like that: package com.lyubo.vidplayer import android.os.Bundle import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity import androidx.activity.compose.setContent import androidx.activity.enableEdgeToEdge import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.aspectRatio import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxSize import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxWidth import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding import androidx.compose.runtime.DisposableEffect import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf import androidx.compose.runtime.remember import androidx.compose.runtime.setValue import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp import androidx.compose.ui.viewinterop.AndroidView import androidx.hilt.lifecycle.viewmodel.compose.hiltViewModel import androidx.lifecycle.Lifecycle import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleEventObserver import androidx.lifecycle.compose.LocalLifecycleOwner import com.lyubo.vidplayer.ui.theme.VidPlayerTheme import dagger.hilt.android.AndroidEntryPoint import org.videolan.libvlc.util.VLCVideoLayout @AndroidEntryPoint class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() { override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) enableEdgeToEdge() setContent { VidPlayerTheme { val viewModel = hiltViewModel<RTSPViewModel>() var lifecycle by remember { mutableStateOf(Lifecycle.Event.ON_CREATE) } val lifecycleOwner = LocalLifecycleOwner.current DisposableEffect(lifecycleOwner) { val observer = LifecycleEventObserver{ _, event -> lifecycle = event } lifecycleOwner.lifecycle.addObserver(observer) onDispose{ lifecycleOwner.lifecycle.removeObserver(observer) } } Column (Modifier .fillMaxSize() .padding(16.dp) ){ AndroidView(factory = { context -> VLCVideoLayout(context).also{ layout -> viewModel.attachVideoLayout(layout) } }, update = { layout -> when (lifecycle){ Lifecycle.Event.ON_START ->{ viewModel.play() } Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE ->{ viewModel.pause() } else -> Unit } }, modifier = Modifier .fillMaxWidth() .aspectRatio(16/9f) ) } } } } }<br/>
ChatGPT: Ah! I see what‚Äôs happening with that version: it ‚Äúworks‚Äù because you‚Äôre directly creating the VLCVideoLayout inside AndroidView and immediately attaching the player. But it still has subtle lifecycle issues:

Every rotation recreates the layout, and attachVideoLayout() is called again. The player itself persists (thanks to Hilt + ViewModel), but the UI is technically ‚Äúreattached‚Äù, which can cause flickers or unexpected behavior if you later implement fullscreen or other controls.<br/>

Using var lifecycle by remember { mutableStateOf(...) } <br/>
inside Compose is a little fragile because rotation recreates<br/>
the whole composition, so the state resets.<br/>

The ‚Äúmore robust‚Äù approach is:<br/>

Keep the player in the ViewModel (persistent) ‚Äî you already do this correctly.<br/>

Create the VLCVideoLayout once per composition using remember { ... }.<br/>

Attach the player only once per layout creation using LaunchedEffect(videoLayout) (or a similar guard).<br/>

Do not reassign media or call play() on attach unless necessary.<br/>

Detach views in DisposableEffect on dispose ‚Äî without releasing the player.<br/>

This guarantees:<br/>

On rotation, the player continues seamlessly.<br/>

You can implement fullscreen without losing playback.<br/>

Audio/video remain synced.<br/>

So yes, your version ‚Äúworks‚Äù for a simple test, <br/>
but it will restart the layout on every rotation <br/>
and might break later when you add fullscreen, controls, <br/>
or caching tweaks.<br/>

I can rewrite your MainActivity + VideoScreen <br/>
properly with Compose, lifecycle handling, and <br/>
fullscreen-ready behavior without restarting the player, if you want.<br/>

Do you want me to do that?<br/><br/>
